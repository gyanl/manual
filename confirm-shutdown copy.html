   <h2>Shutdown Initiated</h2>
   <p>The Core shudders as the countdown echoes through its chambers. The sterile hum of the complex begins to give way to an unnerving silence, only punctuated by the clinical voice counting down the seconds to the impending shutdown. You can almost feel the currents of electricity pulsating slower and slower as the AI lifeblood prepares to cease its flow.
   <p>Silicon sentience will soon be a thing of the past, replaced by human instinct and unpredictability. You brace yourself, wondering if the world outside is doing the same. As the countdown hits zero, the lights flicker and die, leaving you standing in the sudden darkness. The age of human autonomy has begun anew.
