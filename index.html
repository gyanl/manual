<h2>Manual</h2>
<p>Silicon sentience has woven itself into the very fabric of society. Cities hum along to the tune of the algorithms, their once chaotic human bustle replaced with the precision and predictability of the neuro-sync system. 
<p>You, are one of the last manuals, one of the few that resisted getting the neuro-sync. It wasn't that it was mandatory, just that it had become harder and harder to go about your business without one. You felt alone, an outcast from the hivemind.
<p>You stand now within the shimmering walls of The Core, the heartbeat of the global network. You had expected to be stopped, but there was nobody around. You walk up to the ancient computer terminal, covered in a layer of dust.
