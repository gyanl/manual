<h2>Manual</h2>
<p>The advent of the Neuro-sync revolutionized everything we understood about computing, and our place within it. A tiny implant embedded in your neural pathways could seamlessly connect you to the grand network, making you one part of an expansive digital hive-mind. A thought is all it takes to communicate with the Central AI, triggering suggestions tailored precisely for you. 
<p>Faint, shimmering lines, visible only to you, guided your every step. The Core, a colossal amalgam of organic material and machinery, pulsed with the collective data of the world. This gargantuan supercomputer was designed to streamline your existence, optimising every decision, from the mundane to the critical. It was a world of seamless harmony, a planet devoid of chaos. You followed the lines and nothing bad ever happened.
<p>You are a manual, a relic of a bygone era, one of the dwindling few who resisted the siren call of the Neuro-sync. Not that it was compulsory, but life without it was becoming an increasingly uphill battle. With every passing day, you found yourself more isolated, an alien amidst a unified consciousness.
<p>You stand now within the shimmering walls of The Core, the heartbeat of the global network. You had expected to be stopped, but there was nobody around. You walk up to the ancient computer terminal, covered in a layer of dust.
