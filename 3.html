   <h2>Manual Override</h2>
   <p>Neon lights reflect off the monsoon-slicked streets of Mumbai, casting a psychedelic array of colours across the ancient and modern structures alike. You find yourself outside a bar, the throbbing music muffled into a dull roar as you stare at the faintly glowing lines on the wet pavement. They beckon you home, an insistent, unerring guide towards a reality you're not ready to face tonight.</p>
   <p>The Neuro-sync. You loathed the very mention of it. The idea of linking your mind to a vast, impersonal network, surrendering your decisions, your privacy to an AI - it was unthinkable. You held out, defying societal pressure and the tide of technological advancement. But the world around you didn't stop changing. </p>
   <p>The magic of the Neuro-sync had seeped into every corner of life. Job postings now listed the implant as a prerequisite. Public transport, like the high-speed maglevs, required passengers to sync their travel paths with the system for efficiency. Marketplaces functioned seamlessly with digital currencies transacted through a mere thought. Entertainment was a personalised, immersive experience, tapping directly into the sensory and emotional centres of the brain. Even friendships, relationships, had transformed. Conversations flowed in private mental chat rooms, expressions of affection rendered as sensory experiences.</p>
   <p>It wasn't a mandatory procedure, but refusing the Neuro-sync was equivalent to self-imposed exile from modern society. An existence on the periphery, watching life go by but never truly participating.</p>
   <p>Eventually, survival instinct won over your stubborn resistance. You got the Neuro-sync. Your life turned from a black and white film reel to a high definition, virtual reality experience. Everything became easier, smoother - but also less real.</p>
   <p>Staring at the lines guiding you home, you stubbornly plant your feet. No, you don't want to go home. Not today. Perhaps, if you ignore the lines long enough, they might just fade away.
