   <h2>Reality</h2>
   <p>You begin to respond to the AI, articulating your thoughts on the delicate balance between chaos and order...</p>
   <p>Mid-sentence, you stop. A sudden wave of boredom washes over you. Arguing with a computer program about the nuances of human existence isn't very fun. Maybe you should take a walk, go outside and touch some grass.</p>
   <p>Ignoring the AI, you reach up and pull off the virtual reality glasses you had almost forgotten you were wearing. The high-tech walls of the Core dissolve into the familiar, comforting sight of your own living room. </p>
